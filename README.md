The game is separated into 2 distinct levels. The first level involves a game of dodgeball, and the second level is an oldschool style FPS. 

How to play: 
* Level 1:
  * Use WASD to move.
  * Hold left mouse button to build up throwing power; release to throw.
  * Blue balls are safe to pick up. Avoid RED balls at all costs.
 
* Level 2:
  * Use WASD to move.
  * Use left mouse button to shoot rubber bands.
  

The theme, "throwback", is referenced in several ways:
* During dodgeball, you must "throw back" the balls at your opponent.
* All graphics in the game use the NES color pallette.
* The second level is a throwback to oldschool FPS games like Doom or Wolfenstein.
* All music and sound effects in the game were purposefully made in a retro style.
* The game takes place in a high school - a throwback to the days of our youth.
